## Summary
1. Project structure
2. Run models

## 1. Project structure
__Data :__ This folder contains the dev and train dataset in all different languages \
__Models :__ This folder contains our different models \
__Submissions :__ This folder contains our results from the different models

## 2. Run models
Our models are built to be run on Colab from Google : https://colab.research.google.com/ . In this way, you must upload all the models and the data on Google Drive.
